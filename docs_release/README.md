## Prepare release

- Create a branch named `prepare-release` to prepare the new release for OUDS iOS version X.Y.Z.

    ```shell
    # For example in CLI
    git checkout -b prepare-release develop
    ```

- Switch to this branch and apply following changes:
    
    - Update the changelog.

    ```
    \## [Unreleased]\(https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ouds-ios/compare/P.Q.R...develop)
    ```
     to

     ```
     \## [X.Y.Z]\(https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ouds-ios/compare/P.Q.R...X.Y.Z) - YYYY-MM-dd
    ```
    where P.Q.R is the previous version tag, X.Y.Z the version we are releasing.

    <!-- TODO Add AppNews file details -->

    - Ensure the marketing version defined in Xcode is updated with the new X.Y.Z
    <!-- TODO Add details about docs -->
    <!-- - Update the version precised in *home_content* file -->
    <!-- - Archive the documentation in `docs/X.Y.Z`. -->
    <!-- - Update Jekyll configuration files.<br /><br /> -->

- Verify the changes mentioned above, then commit and push.
    ```shell
    git add --all                           # Or make more fine add of course if you want
    git commit -s -m $'your commit message' # For example "Prepare version X.Y.Z", -S for GPG sign is allowed but not mandatory
    git push origin prepare-release
    ```

    <!-- TODO Add reference and mention to documentaiton build -->
    <!-- Please see [DEVELOP.md](../.github/DEVELOP.md#documentation) to get more information about how to build and verify the documentation. -->

    <!-- Once the Jekyll server is started, the documentation for version X.Y.Z should be available at http://127.0.0.1:4000/ods-ios/X.Y.Z/. -->

- Create a new pull request named `Prepare release X.Y.Z` on GitHub to merge your branch into `develop`.

- Review and merge this pull request on GitHub.<br /><br />

## Release

- Create a new pull request named `Release X.Y.Z` on GitHub to merge `develop` into `main`.

- Review and merge this pull request on GitHub. The merge strategy must be a **simple merge without squash of commits** (this strategy is only dedicated to feature branches to merge in develop branch). The _merge commit_ can be defined so as to bring details about the merge and make links automatically with GitHub issues. To do that, you can copy/paste the content of the changelog (after the version line) and uncomment (i.e. remove # symbols) lines. Thus if in the commit message body any issue is referenced, it will appear in the associated issue. Do not forget also to add people as co-authors if needed.

Below is an example of what should be a merge commit in `main` branch for a release (ignore of course // lines, see [this commit for example](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ouds-ios/commit/98640b4b63037c2780128f41ceba5b896763b94f)):

```text
Version 0.2.0 (#113) // <--- Commit title, #113 is PR nummber

// Below is commit body, keep an empty line
Release of version 0.2.0
See below the full CHANGELOG details.

// Keep also an empty line above
// And copy/paste changelog without #
Added:
- [Tests] Add UI regression tests using snapshot comparisons with *swift-snapshot-testing* tool ([#78](#78))
- [DemoApp] Display fake components for elevation rendering tests

Changed:
- [Library] Split raws, semantics and components tokens definitions and also values, composites and type aliases
- [Showcase] Improve Fastlane alpha build notifications

Removed:
- [Library] Remove Z Index tokens for elevations ([#109](#109))

Fixed:
- [Library] Fix some typos in documentation ([#89](#89))

// Add in co authors anyone working on the commits being merged

```

- Generate documentation from Swift sources, it will update online version and generate a ZIP file in _/tmp_
    ```shell
    ./generateDoc.sh --libversion=X.Y.Z --usegit
    # --usegit means updating GitHub Pages branch
    # Add --nozip if you don't want a ZIP file
    # X.Y.Z here is just the version number to display in main index.html pages, replace values of course
    ```
    
- Launch a job on your runner to build the demo application

- Or use _Fastlane_ command:
    ```shell
    # Variables for application signing
    export OUDS_DEVELOPER_APP_IDENTIFIER=<your_app_identifier>
    export OUDS_FASTLANE_APPLE_ID=<your_apple_email_address>
    export OUDS_DEVELOPER_PORTAL_TEAM_ID=<your_developer_portal_team_ID>
    
    # Variables to Upload to TestFlight
    export OUDS_APPLE_KEY_ID = <your_key_ID>
    export OUDS_APPLE_ISSUER_ID = <your_issuer_ID>
    export OUDS_APPLE_KEY_CONTENT = <your_key_content>
    
    bundle exec fastlane prod upload:true
    # set "upload" to true if you want to upload app to TestFlight, false otherwise.
    ```

### Publish release to GitHub

- Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ouds-ios/releases).

- Click on `Draft a new release`.

    <!-- TODO Update screenshot -->
    <!-- ![Edit GitHub release](images/github_release_01.png) -->

- Create a new tag X.Y.Z. **Warning, maybe git-cliff will need tag prefixed by v, so the documentation should be applied with this new rule**

    <!-- TODO Update screenshot -->
    <!-- ![Create tag](images/github_release_02.png) -->

- Add release notes and verify using the preview tab.

    <!-- TODO Check with git-cliff release note generation and vTag prefix -->

- Optionally check `Set as a pre-release` and click `Publish release`.<br /><br />

<!-- TODO Section about annoucement -->
<!--
### Announce the new release on FoODS

- Go to [Teams - FoODS: ODS Mobile iOS]

- Post a message with screenshots of new elements to announce the release.

    As Microsoft Teams does not support pasting Markdown, open the text below in a Markdown editor that produces rich text, copy the rich text and paste it to Microsoft Teams. Finally edit the message to display the emojis and add newlines wherever needed.


    > (rocket) Release X.Y.Z is available!
    >
    > **New components**
    >- C8
    >- C9

    >
    >(phone) [Demo app]("http://oran.ge/dsapp")
    >
-->

- Do not forget to update the documentation using `generateDoc.sh` script. It will let a ZIP file of the documentation in */tmp* folder ; get this file and add it as release artifact, or if you want just download the sources from GitHub on *gh-pages* branch. You should also through Xcode build the documentation (_Product > Build Documentation_) and export each documentation catalog as documentation archive (doccarchive) (_Right click on catalog > Export), compress all these files in one ZIP archive (GitHub consider them as empty so won't accept them for upload) and upload as artifact.

## Prepare Next Release

- Create a branch named `prepare-new-release` to prepare the new release for OUDS iOS version U.V.W.

- Switch to this branch and apply following changes:
    
    - Update the changelog.
    
    Add a section like:
     ```
    \## [Unreleased]\(https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ouds-ios/compare/X.Y.Z...develop)
    ```
    
    - Update in Xcode the version of Showcase target to U.V.W (the new version you suppose it will be) and increment build number
    - Commit your modifications
    - Push them to the repository
    - Create a new pull request named `Update release U.V.W` on GitHub to merge your branch into `develop`.
    - Review and merge this pull request on GitHub.<br /><br />

## About documentation

The documentation tool in use is [Swift DocC](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/), and the [swift-docc](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc) plugin is sued to build the HTML documentation.
To do that, the `generateDoc.sh` script has been defined, and helps to build the HTML documentation, compress it as archive file and also update the GitHub Pages dedicated branch.

```shell
# To show the help:
./generateDoc.sh --help

# To build the doc and push to GitHub:
# VERSION will be added in the main page
# --usegit make the script upload sources to GitHub
./generateDoc.sh --libversion=VERSION --usegit

# If you don't want the ZIP to be computed:
./generateDoc.sh --libversion=VERSION --usegit --nozip
```

Keep in mind everything is stored in _/tmp_ folder with the execution timestamp, thus if you asked for a ZIP archive or want to get the generated files, look for files named "ouds-docs".

The *swift-docc* plugin has troubles for Swift Package with several targets, we should wait for evolutions, an [issue has been created about evolutions of doc we would like to have](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ouds-ios/issues/95). It cannot also manage _UIKit_, so we are not able to use it anymore because of the accessibility features we need in our codebase, available in _UIKit_ and not _SwiftUI_ (see [#168]((https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ouds-ios/issues/168).)

The plugin produces a lot of files, a lot. For example for our v0.1.0, more than 6,000 files have been created for a ZIP archive of about 17 MB.
Thus, keeping all versions of the documentation is a non-sense, no one will read it and it will increase the size of the branch in our VCS tool, consuming a lot of bandwidth, and reaching limits of Git to handle large amounts of file. We would like to avoid to force developers to define a specific Git configuration to handle such massive branch.

We prefer to build ZIP documentation and Xcode doccarchives to add as artifacts of releases.
Thus, the online version of the documentation is for the last release, and each release in GitHub contains doccarchive files generated through Xcode and ZIP of HTML files picked from the *gh-pages*.

## About CI/CD with GitLabCI

You can setup in your side a _GitLab CI_ runner which can trigger some _Fastlane_ actions for example each night.
However of course you will need _distribution certificate_ (in .p12 format with private key) and the _release provisioning profile_ in your runner keychain.
Of course you will need also to fill secrets and environement variables.

Note that the *GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN* mus be a fine grained personal access token with permissions *read and write* for *contents*, *read only* for *metadata*, and *read and write* for *commit statuses* and *issues*. Click on [this hyperlink](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) to create such token, however you may need to contact your GitHub organization admins for validation or help. For [Orange-OpenSource](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource), use the usual help address you should know.

## How it works

### Alpha builds

The *alpha* builds must be created using a manual trigger of our internal pipeline. It needs a <a href="./images/build-alpha-GitHub-branch-commit.png">branch</a> to pull with sources to builds, and some issue(s) number(s). The last commit hash will be computed and used. A first step will prepare the build then a second step will build and upload the app.

The *alpha* build then will be uploaded <a href="./images/build-alpha-TestFlight-console.png">automatically to _TestFlight_</a> and <a href="./images.build-alpha-TestFlight-app.jpeg">available for a team</a> defined in the `fastlane/Appfile` (here *alpha-team*).

Both our <a href="./images/build-alpha-Mattermost-details.png">_Mattermost_ hook</a> and the _Fastlane_ lanes produce details about the build like <a href="./images/build-alpha-GitLabCI-meta_details.png">version, issues</a> and <a href="./images/build-alpha-GitLabCI-build_number.png">build number</a>.

There are also in the app <a href="./images/build-alpha-in_app.jpeg">some extra fields</a> defined in the app _Info.plist_ through _Fastlane_ and _GitLab CI_ showing the app version, its build number, the build type (DEBUG for local builds, ALPHA for alpha release, BETA for beta release, PROD for production release) and the build details (issues numbers). The <a href="./images/build-alpha-display_name.jpeg">display name</a> will be modified too.

### Beta builds

The *beta* builds are created with a scheduled pipeline.
This is quite the same logic as *alpha builds*, but with Git tags associated to the builds on *develop* branch (one for the build prefixed by *ci/*, one for TestFlight upload prefixed by *Test_Flight*) with commit hash as suffix.

The *beta* build is automatically uploaded to _TestFlight_ for a dedicated team (here *beta-team*).

The *Mattermsot* hook is also used, the app display name and the build details are updated too.
