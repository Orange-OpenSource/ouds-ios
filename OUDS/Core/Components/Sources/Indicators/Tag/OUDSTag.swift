/// A tag is a small element that shows short information like a label, keyword, or category.
/// It helps users quickly find, group, or understand content.
///
/// ## Hierarchies
///
/// Tags have two hierarchies so as to highlight or not their content.
///
/// - **emphasized**: A tag with a solid, high-contrast background. Used to draw strong attention to important
/// labels or categories. Emphasized tags stand out prominently against the interface and are ideal for
/// primary or high-priority information.
///
/// - **muted**: A tag with a subtle, light, or semi-transparent background. Used for secondary or
/// less prominent information. Muted tags blend more with the background, providing a softer visual
/// emphasis compared to emphasized tags.
///
/// ## Status
///
/// Tags have seven status depending on the context of the information they represent. Each state is designed
/// to convey a specific meaning and ensure clarity in communication.
///
/// - **Neutral**: Default or inactive state. Used for standard labels, categories, or when no specific
/// status needs to be communicated.
///
/// - **Accent**: Used to draw attention to new features, recommendations, or content suggestions.
/// Invites users to explore and engage with new offerings, creating an exciting and engaging experience.
///
/// - **Positive**: Indicates success, confirmation, or a positive status. Commonly used to highlight
/// completed actions or approved items.
///
/// - **Warning**: Signals caution or a potentially risky situation. Used to draw attention to items
/// requiring user awareness or intervention.
///
/// - **Negative**: Represents errors, critical issues, or urgent attention needed. Used to highlight
///  problems or failed actions.
///
/// - **Info**: Conveys informational messages or supplementary details. Used for neutral, helpful,
/// or contextual information.
///
/// - **Disabled**: Shows that the tag is inactive and cannot be interacted with. Appears faded or greyed out. This is not
///  allowed when loader is activated.
///
/// ## Shape
///
/// Tags can have two shapes.
///
/// - **Rounded**: A tag with fully rounded corners, creating a pill-shaped appearance. Rounded
/// tags offer a softer and more approachable look, suitable for most modern interfaces.
///
/// - **Square**: A tag with sharp, square corners. Squared tags provide a more formal, structured, or
/// technical feel. They are often used in business contexts to label promotions, offers, or important notices.
///
/// ## Size
///
/// Tags can have two sizes.
///
/// - **Default**: The standard tag size, suitable for most use cases and offering good readability.
///
/// - **Small**: A compact tag with reduced height and font size. Used when saving space is important or
/// when grouping elements visually.
///
/// ## Layout
///
/// There are four available layouts for tags.
///
/// -**Text only**: A tag that displays only text. Used for simple labels, categories, or keywords without additional visual
///  elements.
///
///  -**Text + Bullet**: A tag with a small indicator (dot) alongside the text. Used to show status, presence, or activity
///  next to the label.
///
/// -**Text + Icon**: A tag that includes an icon before the text. Used to visually reinforce the meaning of the tag,
/// such as status, type, or action.
///
/// - **Text + Loader**: A tag that combines a loading spinner (or progress indicator) with text. Used to indicate that
/// a process or action related to the tag is in progress.
///
/// ## Code samples
///
/// ```swift
///     // Text only with neutral status, for emphasized hierarchy with rounded shape in default size
///     OUDSTag(label: "Label", hierarchy: .emphasized, status: .neutral, shape: .rounded, size: .default)
///     // Or also
///     OUDSTag(label: "Label")
///
///     // Text with bullet and negative status, using default hierarchy (emphasized), shape (rounded) and size (default)
///     OUDSTag(label: "Label", icon: .bullet, status: .negative)
///
///     // Tag with label and icon with image
///     OUDSTag(label: "Label", icon: .asset(Image("ic_heart")))
///
///     // Tag with label and loader, but defined with an image which won't be displayed while loader is active
///     OUDSTag(label: "Label", icon: .asset(Image("ic_heart")), hasLoader: true)
///
///     // If your layout is in RTL model but your tag has an icon with another meaning because of bad orientation,
///     // you can flip the icon
///     OUDSTag(label: "Label", icon: .asset(Image("ic_heart")), flipIcon: true)
/// ```
