infix operator <|

/// In the *Figma* global design system, composite tokens are defined for font-related things.
/// Composite tokens are tokens defined in *Figma* by other tokens.
/// Here a *font* thing is caracterized by a *font size*, a *line height*, a *font weight* and *letter spacing* values.
/// All these elements are *raw tokens*, and together define a *composite raw token* for *font* thing.
