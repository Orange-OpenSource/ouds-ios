// Software description: A SwiftUI components library with code examples for Orange Unified Design System 
//

/// Defined as the group of all **raw tokens** related to **opacity**.
/// Values are defined in *OpacityRawTokens+Values.swift* file and generated by the tokenator.
/// `OpacityRawTokens` are tokens to use to define *opacity* effects thanks to `OpacityRawToken`.
///
/// Primitive types such as `Double` must be used to as to allow to use `@objc` keywords in extensions for overriding.
/// Such tokens are packed in a _Swift enum_ so as to gather them in one object with the suitable namespace and avoid to have just constants in nothing else
///  (i.e. publicly accessible from everywhere). More optimized than _struct_.
public enum OpacityRawTokens {

    // ଘ( ･ω･)_/ﾟ･:*:･｡☆
    // Note: So as to help the Figma-JSON-to-Swift parser the values have been added in the Values folder
    // This trick helps also to write documentation for these tokens as the tokenator cannot generate documentation
}
