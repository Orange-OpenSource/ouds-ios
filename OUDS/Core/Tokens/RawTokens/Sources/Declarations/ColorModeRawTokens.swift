// Software description: A SwiftUI components library with code examples for Orange Unified Design System 
//

/// Defined as the group of all **raw tokens** related to **colors mode**.
/// Values are defined in *ColorModeRawTokens+Values.swift* file and not generated by the tokenator, as frozen values.
/// ``ColorModeRawTokens`` are tokens to use to define *color mode* of components, i.e. if a comonent or something must be considered
/// in light or dark color scheme, or in monochrome mode.
///
/// Primitive types such as  `String` must be used to as to allow to use `@objc` keywords in extensions for overriding.
/// Such tokens are packed in a _Swift enum_ so as to gather them in one object with the suitable namespace and avoid to have just constants in nothing else
///  (i.e. publicly accessible from everywhere). More optimized than _struct_.
///
/// - Since: 0.13.0
public enum ColorModeRawTokens {

    // ଘ( ･ω･)_/ﾟ･:*:･｡☆
    // Note: For consistancy reasons, even if the code is not generated by tokentaors,
    // the values have been added in the Values folder
}
