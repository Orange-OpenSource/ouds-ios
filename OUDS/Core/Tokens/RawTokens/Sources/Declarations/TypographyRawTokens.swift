//

/// Defined as the group of all **raw tokens** related to **typography**.
/// Values are defined in *TypographyRawTokens+Values.swift* file  generated by the tokenator and in *TypographyRawTokens+Composites.swift* updated manualy by the develoment team.
/// ``TypographyRawTokens`` are tokens to use for *typography* thinss , i.e. kind of values to use to render texts.
/// These tokens define:
///     - the *font family* to apply (``TypographyFontFamilyRawToken``)
///     - the *font weight* (``TypographyFontWeightRawToken``),
///     - the *font size* (``TypographyFontSizeRawToken``)
///     - the line height (``TypographyFontLineHeightRawToken``)
///     - and the *font letter spacing* (``TypographyFontLetterSpacingRawToken``).
/// Combinations of these raw tokens can be made inside ``FontCompositeRawToken``, which are composite tokens defining in the end a specific typography to apply.
///
/// Primitive types such as `Int` and `String` must be used to as to allow to use `@objc` keywords in extensions for overriding.
/// Such tokens are packed in a _Swift enum_ so as to gather them in one object with the suitable namespace and avoid to have just constants in nothing else
///  (i.e. publicly accessible from everywhere). More optimized than _struct_.
public enum TypographyRawTokens {

    // ଘ( ･ω･)_/ﾟ･:*:･｡☆
    // Note: So as to help the tokenator, the values have been added in the Values folder
    // This trick helps also to write documentation for these tokens as the tokenator cannot generate documentation
}
