# ``OUDSTokensSemantic``

These _tokens_ can be used mainly for _component tokens_ ([OUDSTokensComponent](https://ios.unified-design-system.orange.com/documentation/oudstokenscomponent/)) to apply some style and configuration values ; today _component tokens_ or _components_ are not defined yet.
They can be seen as an high level of usage with functional meanings.

## Overview

If we need for example to change a warning color, supposing this color is defined as a _semantic token_, we only have to change its assigned value and all components using the _semantic token_ won't be impacted in their definition. In fact, semantic tokens are here to bring meaning, semantic, between raw values and components.

In addition, there are hundreds of _semantics tokens_ which must be exposed in the end through the theme. Each _semantic token_ "family" is declared in its dedicated _Swift protocol_. This protocol is then used for the tokens providers embeded inside the theme.

Because we choose to split responsabilities and objects into their own modules, we faced troubles to make possible for children themes to override properties declared in _protocols_ and defined in _extensions_.
That is the reason why tokens are exposed as `@objc open` to be available and overridable anywhere. 

To keep the same semantics as the ones used in our specifications, _typealias_ are used so as to make the links to _primitive types_ and our logic of _tokens_. These type aliases are available for those who want to make their own theme.

Example with ``ColorSemanticTokens``:

```swift
// Declare the semantic tokens
protocol ColorSemanticTokens {

    var colorBgPrimary: ColorSemanticToken { get }
    var colorBgSecondary: ColorSemanticToken { get }
    var colorBgTertiary: ColorSemanticToken { get }
    // ...
}

// Ensure you have a provider
open class OUDSColorSemanticTokensProvider { }

// Define the semantic tokens to expose through the theme thanks to the provider
extension OUDSColorSemanticTokensProvider: ColorSemanticTokens {

    // Color is available in the module of OUDSTheme
    @objc open var colorBgPrimary: ColorSemanticToken { ColorRawTokens.colorFunctionalWhite }

    // If the semantic token refers to a raw token not stored in the OUDSTheme module, override later and throw error because unxpected state if used
    @objc open var colorBgSecondary: ColorSemanticToken { fatalError("ðŸ¤– Raw token unavailable for colorBgSecondary!") }

    // Possible to have tokens not defined in lower level but only in themes implementation, throw error if used because unexpected state
    @objc open var colorBgTertiary: ColorSemanticToken { fatalError("ðŸ¤– No value defined for colorBgTertiary!") }
}

// Add missing values
extension OrangeTheme: ColorSemanticTokens {

    // Define value value with the accessible token 
    @objc open var colorBgSecondary: ColorSemanticToken { OrangeBrandColorRawTokens.colorOrange200 }
    @objc open var colorBgTertiary: ColorSemanticToken { colorBgSecondary }
}
```

## Architecture

The *Multiples* folder contains some _composite class_ defined to pack double values for dedicated needs, like size classes management (_regular_ or _compact_ device modes), and also for color schemes management (_light_ and _dark_ modes).
Such *composites* are not the same as the ones defined in the *Figma* design system, they are just utilities to handle tuple of values, without the syntax of tuples and with some helper functions.

We would like to define one class for all combinations of things depending to light and dark modes, and another for regular and compact modes. However, it implies to use _Swift generics_ and it is not compatible with Objective-C runtime (we use through `@objc` keyword).

The *TypeAliases* folder contains all the *typealias* values used for the semantic tokens.
Indeed these aliases are here to bring clarity and meanings in the library, and also to help users (i.e. developers) to know what kind of objects they handle with the same vocabulary as the one used in *Figma*, and in general, in the whole design system. They can be seen as a light level of abstraction with meanings, without having to define real types with `struct` or `class`.
Type aliases here point to raw tokens aliases, thus by transition they point to real types.

The *Values* folder contains all the semantic tokens declarations through protocols. These protocols will be then implemented by the providers in higher level (i.e. theme level in *OUDS* product or theme products).

The *Providers* folder contains the _Swift class_ used for providers. We do not want to store all the semantic and component tokens in the theme, and the use of providers will ilprove the developer experience. It will wrap all tokens by "family" and should expose them through the suitable protocols.
Type aliases are also defined to merge protocols for the same tokens groups. Thus the `OUDSTheme` will contain wrapers expsoed and use through a subset of protocols.

```swift
// Colors are declared in two protocols: the "simple" and the "multiple"
public protocol ColorSemanticToken { ... }
public protocol ColorMultipleSemanticTokens { ... }

// These protoocols are merged in type aliase
public typealias AllColorSemanticTokens = ColorSemanticTokens & ColorMultipleSemanticTokens

// For example, the provider for the colors basically is:
open class OUDSColorSemanticTokensProvider { ... }

// The provider is composed by protocols containing tokens
extension OUDSColorSemanticTokensProvider: ColorSemanticTokens {
    @objc open var colorOpacityInvisibleBlackLight: ColorSemanticToken { ColorRawTokens.colorOpacityBlack0 }
    @objc open var colorOpacityInvisibleWhiteLight: ColorSemanticToken { ColorRawTokens.colorOpacityWhite0 }
}
extension OUDSColorSemanticTokensProvider: ColorMultipleSemanticTokens {
    @objc open var colorOpacityInvisibleBlack: MultipleColorSemanticTokens { MultipleColorSemanticTokens(light: colorOpacityInvisibleBlackLight, dark: colorOpacityInvisibleBlackDark) }
}

// The "abstract" object of theme expose the provider through this subset of protocols
open class OUDSTheme: @unchecked Sendable {
    public let colors: AllColorSemanticTokens
}

// And finaly, the default theme, which can be subclassed, exposes the tokens through the provider
open class OrangeTheme: OUDSTheme, @unchecked Sendable { ... }

theme.colors.colorOpacityInvisibleBlack
```

## Semantic tokens management

### How to add semantic tokens

First, you need to define which from family this semantic comes. We have today 8 families: *border*, *color*, *elevation*, *grid*, *opacity*, *sizing*, *spacing* and *font*.

If your token is not from one of these groups, maybe you should redesign your token or create a new family. To do that, you will have to create a dedicated Swift `protocol`, with a useful name, and declare as a `var` the semantic token. If you already know the family, just update the matching files.

If you need to define Swift `typealias`, update the suitable file in the *TypeAliases* folder. If you think users may handle your tokens with tuples, or pack of tokens, you can add your own *composite* object.

Please, respect the nomenclature of the files, e.g. for a new family "Awesome semantic" tokens:
- values must be in `AwesomeSemanticTokens.swift`
- type aliases must be in `AwesomeSemanticTokens+Aliases.swift`
- mutiple objects must be in `MultipleAwesomeTokens.swift`

### How to update or remove semantic tokens

Quite simple, find the semantic token you want to update or remove, and update or remove it.
But beware, if you change the name of the property or if you move it from a `protocol` to another, or if you remove the token, you must keep retrocompatibility as much as possible so as to avoid to break any public API. Keep also the CHANGELOG and/or the release updated with some BREAKING CHANGE notification, and also the Git history clean.

If you update the value, keep also the CHANGELOG and/or RELEASE NOTE updated so as to let yout users know the variables have been changed.

### About tests of tokens

When semantic tokens have been added, removed or renamed, unit tests must be updated.

We do not test the semantic tokens values as they are, because these values will be generated and keeping up to date the unit tests may be time wasting.
But for each semantic tokens we check if a subtheme can override the token, i.e. update the `MockTheme` by overring the property with a fake value, then compare it to the `OUDSTheme` or `OtherMockTheme` containing a default value. If you have defined also composite objects, add unit tests to check if they do their job.

### Some note about composites

The *tokenator* is not able today to generate composites tokens, i.e. tokens which contain by definition several properties.
For example, *elevation semantic token* dedicated to box shadows are composed by several properties (x, y, blur, shadow).
*Font semantic token* can be token containing several properties too (weight, size, spacing, font family).
These are considered as *composite tokens*. They are defined in dedicated protocols and files.
Thus when the *tokenator* generates tokens without managing composites, the file can still be used as is with generated tokens, and the composites are not erased.

## How to use semantic tokens

In fact, the semantic tokens are declared and gathered in _Swift protocol_ so as to force any theme to implement them, and also to allow any theme to expose such properties wathever the implementation of the theme is, across providers.
Because *semantic tokens* have for values *raw tokens*, and these *raw tokens* have for values primitive types, and all these tokens are declared with *type aliases* refering all together, you can handle a *semantic token* directly in your view because the final value will be used.
Thus, get the theme and call the needed property with some helpers.

```swift
struct SomeView: View {

    @Environment(\.theme) private var theme // Supposed you used in your root view the `OUDSThemeableView` to register the theme
    @Environment(\.colorScheme) private var colorScheme

    var body: some View {
        Rectangle()
            .frame(width: theme.sizes.sizeIconDecorative2Xl, height: theme.sizes.sizeIconDecorativeXl)
            .foregroundColor(theme.colors.colorBgSecondary.color(for: colorScheme))
            .shadow(elevation: theme.elevations.elevationRaised.elevation(for: colorScheme))
            .padding(.bottom, theme.spaces.spaceFixedNone)
    }
/*
    - The theme provides size semantic tokens "sizeIconDecorative2Xl" and "sizeIconDecorativeXl"
    - The theme provides a color semantic token "colorBgSecondary" with values for light and dark scheme, and you can use the color(for:) helper
    - The theme provides an elevation semantic token "elevationRaised" with values for compact and regualr size classes, and you can use the elevation(for:) helper
    - The theme provides a space semantic token "spaceFixedNone" usable as is
    - Environment variables like color scheme must be retrieved through View, and then given to theme
*/
}

// Do not forget in your app to use the `OUDSThemeableView` for your theme, e.g. `OrangeTheme`
@main
struct Showcase: App {

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            OUDSThemeableView(theme: OrangeTheme()) {
                // Your root view
                ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```
