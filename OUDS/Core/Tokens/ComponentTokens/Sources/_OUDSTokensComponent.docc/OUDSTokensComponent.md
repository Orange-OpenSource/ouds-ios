# ``OUDSTokensComponent``

These _tokens_ can be used to apply some style and configuration values to _components_.

## Overview

Thus if a component need to change for example its _background color_, and if a _component token_ is used for it, then only the value of this _token_ should be changed without any modification on the _component_ definition.
_Components_ use _component tokens_ exposed through the _theme_ to get their style values.

❗We don't have any *component token* implemented yet.❗
