# ``OUDSThemesInverse``

This theme overrides the [Orange theme](https://ios.unified-design-system.orange.com/documentation/oudsthemesorange/) for some colors so as to bring an "inverse"-colored experience.

## Overview

This is an override of the [Orange theme](https://ios.unified-design-system.orange.com/documentation/oudsthemesorange/) with some inverted colors. It can override any properties from its superclass. We did not plan to make ``InverseTheme`` derivable.

The aim of the theme is to provide a particular set of colors for dedicated applications and use cases, like for example B2B apps or teams needing eye comfort. It can be seen as an extended dark mode.
