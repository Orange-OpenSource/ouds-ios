/// This enum helps to add new **font raw tokens** exclusive to this ``OrangeTheme``
/// Such tokens are packed in a _Swift enum_ so as to gather them in one object with the suitable namespace and avoid to have just constants in nothing else
///  (i.e. publicly accessible from everywhere). More optimized than _struct_.
///  
/// - Since: 0.8.0
public enum OrangeBrandFontRawTokens {

    // ଘ( ･ω･)_/ﾟ･:*:･｡☆
    // Note: So as to help the tokenator, the values have been added in the Values folder
    // This trick helps also to write documentation for these tokens as the tokenator cannot generate documentation
}
