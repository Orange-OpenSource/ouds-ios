## Overview

Orange is providing a full Design System to build Orange Mobile Application. The objective of the Orange Unified Design System (OUDS) is to propose a set of guidelines on how to apply the Orange Brand on mobile applications. The Orange Unified Design System also provides a series of components and modules that show in details how to use this in the Orange apps.

The Orange Unified Design System has been implemented in a code library that provides:

a SwiftUI code library
a Showcase application that can be launched to show the guidelines, components and modules
this demo app also shows how to use the lib or style existing components
Using these resources will allow you to create Orange branded applications faster and will inherit all the work that was done to make sure that all presented codes are fully tested regarding the brand and the accessibility compliance.

The Orange Unified Design System framework supports iOS 15 and later.
