## Overview

Orange is providing a full design system to build Orange mobile aplications. The objective of *Orange Unified Design System* (OUDS) is to propose a set of guidelines about how to apply the Orange brand on mobile applications. *Orange Unified Design System* also provides series of components and modules that show in details how to use this in the Orange apps.

*Orange Unified Design System* has been implemented in a code library exposed as a _Swift Package_ that provides:

- a SwiftUI code library
- a showcase application that can be launched to show the guidelines, components and modules (which will move outside the project in the future)

This demo app also shows how to use the library or to style existing components.
Using these resources will allow you to create Orange branded applications faster and will inherit all the work that was done to make sure that all presented codes are fully tested regarding the brand, the ecodesign, the open source and the accessibility compliances.

*Orange Unified Design System* framework supports iOS 15 and later.

You can get details about the this design system in [the official website unified-design-system.orange.com](https://unified-design-system.orange.com/).
