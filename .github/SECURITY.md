# Reporting Security Issues

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.
Send an e-mail to [opensource.contact@orange.com](mailto:opensource.contact@orange.com) to report a vulnerability and contact all people in CONTRIBUTORS and MAINTAINERS including the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

Please allow our team sufficient time to resolve the vulnerability before disclosing it ; we'll remain in contact about the fix and may ask for your assistance to verify it is resolved.

We will endeavor to respond quickly, and will keep you updated throughout the process.
