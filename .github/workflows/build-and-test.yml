# Rules for this GitHub Actions workflow
# - workflow can be triggered manually if needed (workflow_dispatch)
# - use "almost" frozen version of macOS
# - is for branches main, develop and all
# - automatically triggered when pull request is opened and has new commits (synchronize)
# But beware, triggered on commit push, so do not be a push-machine-gun!
